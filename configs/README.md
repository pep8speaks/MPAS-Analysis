# MPAS-Analysis

Example config files for various HPC machines and various runs.

The intended usage is to copy one of these examples to the root of 
MPAS-Analysis (where `run_analysis.py` is located) before modifying them
(e.g. setting the output `baseDirectory`) and using them to run the
analysis.
